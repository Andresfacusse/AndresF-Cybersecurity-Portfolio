## Professional Statements
I am Andres Facusse. I have worked . I am an Industrial Engineer and worked as a Production line manager in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. I provide IT technical support Cisco Net infrastructure, installed hotspot databases and redundancy networks to make sure operations maintained stable database extraction (SQL) and interpretation (Jypiter Notebook), application and cyber security support, detected network intrusions and unauthorized use of company technology (Splunk). Although my job wasn't mainly IT related, IoT and other factors led me to be increasingly aware of security flaws and vulnerabilities around the business, I took it upon myself to improve the network architecture, setup firewalls, educate my fellow employees and provide system and application maintenance, and authorization access whenever needed. In addition, my time as a team leader has further allowed me to enhance my interpersonal skills.  

Recently, I completed the Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. The Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate have prepared me for industry-ready jobs. My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats. 

As of 2025, i am preparing to take the `CompTIA Security+`, and `Linux Foundation Certified Associate (LFCA)` certifications.
